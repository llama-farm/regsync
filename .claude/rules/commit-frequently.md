# Commit Frequently

Commit changes frequently throughout development sessions. Don't wait until the end.

## When to Commit

- After completing each distinct feature or fix
- After making UI/UX improvements
- After refactoring code
- Before starting a new task
- When the user explicitly asks

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, style

Examples:
- `feat(chat): Add document version comparison`
- `fix(ui): Reduce header padding`
- `refactor(auth): Clear chat on sign-in`

## Important

- Don't batch multiple unrelated changes into one commit
- Each commit should be atomic and focused
- Run linters before committing when possible
